This project scrapes and aggregates information from Wikipedia articles on the winners of all platinum or world-levelevents in the PSA Squash tournament circuit. This information is not easily found in such a consolidated form, which motivated me to make this. Wikipedia has the most accessible information on these events, and I estimate the articles to be accurate.

The code that sources the information and creates the dataframe is in scrape2.py - the rest of the files were for testing out different methods.
